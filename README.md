# rlibpixelDraw

This is just a small project to test out a c++ wrapper for raylib. (Also my first time using c++)

# Installation

You need to have raylib-cpp in the same folder as main.cpp, you can find it here: [raylib-cpp](https://github.com/RobLoach/raylib-cpp)
You also need to have raylib installed, you can find instructions on the raylib github page: [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)

When these have been installed, just run make.

The make file is very simple and i won't change it for this test project, but feel free to do so, if you get any problems
